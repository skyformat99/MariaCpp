MariaCpp is C++ library that lets you connect to the MariaDB Server Connector C >= 3.0.3  For Linux 
 


Major features of MariaCpp
--------------------------

*   __LGPL__ (with static link exception) license

*   thin C++ wrapper around _MariaDB Connector/C_ (C-API);
    _thin_ means that C++ objects have none (or minimal) internal state,
    and you can possibly mix C++ code with native C-API

*   works with C++98, C++11, C++14 standards

*   it takes benefits of 2 major C++ paradigms: __RAII__ and __exceptions__

*   supports most C-API features, including __prepared statements__

*   supports __multithreading__ (multiple connections to DB)

*   no other dependencies (e.g. no Boost dependency)



Example
-------


```C++
#include <mariacpp/lib.hpp>
#include <mariacpp/connection.hpp>
#include <mariacpp/exception.hpp>
#include <mariacpp/prepared_stmt.hpp>
#include <mariacpp/time.hpp>
#include <mariacpp/uri.hpp>
#include <cstdlib>
#include <iostream>
#include <memory>

using namespace MariaCpp;

const char *uri = "tcp://localhost:3306/test";
const char *user = "test";
const char *passwd = "";

int main()
{
    scoped_library_init maria_lib_init;

    try {
        Connection conn;
        conn.connect(Uri(uri), user, passwd);

        conn.query("CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE test "
                    "(i INT, s CHAR(15), d DATETIME)");
        std::auto_ptr<PreparedStatement> stmt(
            conn.prepare("INSERT INTO test (i,s,d) values(?,?,?)"));

        assert(3 == stmt->param_count());
        stmt->setInt(0, 1);
        stmt->setString(1, "string-1");
        stmt->setDateTime(2, Time("2016-03-23 02:41"));
        stmt->execute();

        stmt->setInt(0, 2);
        stmt->setNull(1);
        stmt->setDateTime(2, Time::datetime(2015, 02, 21, 12, 45, 51));
        stmt->execute();

        stmt.reset(conn.prepare("SELECT i, s, d FROM test ORDER BY i"));
        stmt->execute();
        while (stmt->fetch()) {
            std::cout << "i = " << stmt->getInt(0);
            std::cout << ", s = ";
            if (stmt->isNull(1)) std::cout << "NULL";
            else std::cout << stmt->getString(1);
            std::cout << ", d = " << stmt->getTime(2) ;
            std::cout << std::endl;
        }
        conn.close();
    } catch (Exception &e) {
        std::cerr << e << std::endl;
        return 1;
    }
    return 0;
}
```

    i = 1, s = string-1, d = 2016-03-23 02:41:00
    i = 2, s = NULL, d = 2015-02-21 12:45:51

FAQ
---

**Q**: There exists already MySQL Connector/C++. What's the benefit of MariaCpp?

**A**: The primary difference is a license: MySQL Connector/C++ is __GPL__.
   MariaCpp is licensed as LGPL (__Lesser GPL__) with static link exception.
   Other difference is that _MySQL Connector/C++_ is based on JDBC 4.0 API,
   while MariaCpp API is based on  _MariaDB Connector/C_.
   Nevertheless, migration from MySQL Connector/C++ might be surprisingly easy.

* * *

**Q**: Can I use _MariaCpp_ with _MySQL Connector/C_ as underlying library
   instead of _MariaDB Connector/C_?

**A**: Yes, you can. But please notice that _MySQL Connector/C_ is GPL licensed.
   As result, your code must be GPL licensed as well (or other FLOSS license).
   Sometimes it's not desirable.

* * *

**Q**: Why _MariaCpp_ is licensed as LGPL?

**A**: MariaCpp is licensed in the same spirit as _MariaDB Connector/C_.
